# Example

Playground to test out the npm module. 

## Goals

* QA testing of the npm module before releasing. 
* Testing the API of the npm module. See if the API is suitable for the end developer's experience. 

# Getting started

* Run these commands for setup:

```
nvm use
npm i
npm run link 
```

* Then, in the main project's root directory, run `npm run watch` to put the typescript compiler in watch mode to update the npm module automatically for this example to get the latest module offering.
