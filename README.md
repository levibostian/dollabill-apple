# npm-module-blanky

Opinionated boilerplate used to make and deploy npm modules. 

# Goals of this project

* Contain configuration files to setup all tools I tend to use in my development flow.
* Clone, rename some files, and get developing! 
* Start with zero dependencies. I try my best to keep all npm modules as slim as possible.
